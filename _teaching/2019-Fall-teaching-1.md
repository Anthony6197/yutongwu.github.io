It was my first time being a teaching assistant in the class Introduction to Stats Modeling. I found out that it takes most of the time for students to understand the term Simpsonâ€˜s Paradox and the interaction term in the linear models. My responsibilities including grading homework, holding office hours + review sessions, and grading tests. It was joyful seeing students have their problems solved with my help.
